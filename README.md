# WanderFree
I created an app for anyone who has wanderlust and has aspired to explore the world while becoming their best self and accomplishing everything they've always wanted to. 

My app has a MainActivity, 4 Fragments, an ApolloClient for my CountryQuery graphQl, a CountryViewHolder, and RecyclerViewAdapter. There are also corresponding XML
Resource files. 

I used the Apollo Countries graphQl from the following site: https://studio.apollographql.com/public/countries/home
